# ValorantDiscordBot
A Discord bot that is focused on Valorant players across the world. It will help the users to get immediate access to their statistics of the game, different tutorials, tips and tricks, agent guides, and other resources with help of simple commands that will return results in real-time.
After playing Valorant for almost a year, I faced these difficulties quite a lot, so I thought of solving them on my own. 
I made a bot that saves our time and gives accurate results without misleading us to wasteful resources.

Note: I have made use of the online resources that are available to the public. I do not own the rights to those resources and websites. I just wrote the code to help me make impactful strategies for the game.

**The whole script was written on repl.it so the discord app token is stored on my repl profile as a secret system environment variable. Every app on discord has a different token so my actual token doesn't matter as I can regenerate it and change the existing one anytime I feel like.**
